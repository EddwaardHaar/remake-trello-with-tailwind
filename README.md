# remake-trello-with-tailwind

This is a static website remake of the popular project management tool, Trello, using the Tailwind CSS framework.
 
What I learned during this project:
- **how to setup tailwind**, 
- **practiced flex & grid**, 
- **how to edit config file**, 
- **how to add my own colors to the tailwindcss**, 
- **purge css, smaller file == better file**, 
- **how to create own utilities in tailwindcss**, 
- **creating popup and adding small animations**, 
- **responsivity for many devices**, 
- **how to create components to have cleaner html code**, 
- **better understanding how SVG is working** etc.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in your web browser
3. That's it!

## Future Plans
I plan to continue developing this project by adding Vue.js and making the website work for real.
